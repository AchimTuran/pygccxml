Download & Install
==================

Prerequisite: CastXML
---------------------

You need to have `CastXML`_ installed.

Installation of pygccxml
------------------------

You can use pip to install pygccxml:

  pip install pygccxml

To install from source, you can use the usual procedure:

  python setup.py install

GCC-XML (Legacy)
----------------

These instructions are only here for historical reasons; `pygccxml` is now using
`CastXML` by default.

There are few different ways to install `GCC-XML`_ on your system:

1. If you use Linux, than I am almost sure your system provides the "gccxml" package.
   Consider to install it using "native"(rpm, deb, portage) packaging system.

2. Another option is to install it from the source code. See the `instructions`_ here.
   Installation from sources supported for Windows, Linux and Mac platforms.
