Summary: Python package for easy C++ declarations navigation
License: Boost Software License
Description: "...The purpose of the GCC-XML extension is to generate an XML description of a
        C++ program from GCC's internal representation. Since XML is easy to parse,
        other development tools will be able to work with C++ programs without the
        burden of a complicated C++ parser..."
