History
=======

The original author and maintainer for pygccxml was Roman Yakovenko (2004-2011).
Holger Frydrych forked the project to work on python 3 support. Finally, Mark Moll
forked the project a second time to carry on the work of porting the code
to python 3 (keeping it compatible with python 2).

In Mai 2014, Michka Popoff and the Insight Software Consortium revived pygccxml
by setting up a git repositery on Github, hosted along with gccxml.

The full changelog of this project can be found in CHANGELOG.md file.
