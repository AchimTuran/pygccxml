GCC-XML
-------
There are few different ways to install `GCC-XML`_ on your system:

1. If you use Linux, than I am almost sure your system provides the "gccxml" package.
   Consider to install it using "native"(rpm, deb, portage) packaging system.

2. Another option is to install it from the source code. See `instructions`_
   provided by Brad King, the author of `GCC-XML`_. Installation from sources
   is supported for Windows, Linux and Mac platforms.
